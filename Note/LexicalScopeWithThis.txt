* Context in Arrow Functions (this is Lexical)
Arrow functions do not have their own this. They inherit this from their surrounding scope.

const obj = {
    name: "Alice",
    sayHello: () => {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
};

obj.sayHello(); // `this` refers to the outer scope (window), so undefined

Since sayHello is an arrow function, this does not refer to obj but instead to the surrounding context (window).
